      "Confirmation bias is a self defeating attempt to impose one's own bias on the market. This most often results in pre-trade chart blindness. When we analyze the market with a preset bias, we will only see confluences, patterns, price action, and setups that confirm our bias. This is the human flaw of needing to be correct. The need to be correct will cause traders to subconsciously ignore chart information that would prove us wrong. Confirmation bias results is the inability to objectively analyze the market.",
